# ExpenseReimbursement

The Expense Reimbursement System (ERS) manages the process of reimbursing employees for expenses incurred while on company time. 
All employees can log in and submit requests for reimbursement and view their past tickets and pending requests. Managers can then 
log in and view all reimbursement requests and past history for all employees. These managers are authorized to approve and deny 
requests for expense reimbursements.
